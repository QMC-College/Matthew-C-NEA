Plan to Integrate Dijkstra's Algorithm into Maze Game

Step 1: Represent the Maze as a Graph

Treat each cell as a node.

Identify accessible neighbors by checking cell walls.

Store the neighbors and movement cost in a graph structure.

Step 2: Implement Dijkstra’s Algorithm

Use a priority queue to track nodes and distance.

Maintain a set to avoid revisiting nodes.

Track older for path reconstruction.

Start from the player’s position (top left) and calculate shortest path to the finish.

Step 3: Reconstruct the Shortest Path

After the algorithm finishes, trace back from the goal to the start using older.

Store this path as a sequence of cell coordinates.

Step 4: Integrate Path Drawing into the Game

Draw the path visually on the screen, using coordinates from the shortest path.

Update the path as the player moves, recalculating position dist to the finish.
